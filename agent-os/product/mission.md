## The Problem

### Fragmented E-commerce Solutions
Small-to-medium businesses face a difficult choice: either pay for expensive custom development or settle for generic, one-size-fits-all platforms that don't meet their specific needs. Most solutions lack proper multi-branch support, making it difficult for growing businesses to manage multiple locations. Additionally, businesses struggle to maintain a consistent brand experience when their online store looks identical to thousands of other merchants on the same platform.

**Our Solution:** Lanzate provides an affordable, feature-rich platform that gives each merchant their own branded subdomain and customizable storefront, while offering enterprise-level features like multi-branch management, employee roles, real-time analytics, and integrated payment processing.

### Disconnected Sales Channels
Businesses with both online and physical locations often use separate systems for e-commerce and in-store sales, leading to inventory discrepancies, order confusion, and poor customer experience. Walk-in customers and online shoppers are tracked differently, making it impossible to get a unified view of the business.

**Our Solution:** Lanzate unifies online and walk-in sales in a single platform, allowing employees to process both types of orders, maintain synchronized inventory across branches, and view comprehensive analytics that span all sales channels.

### Unreliable POS Systems
Traditional cash registers and POS systems fail during power outages, forcing businesses to either lose sales or resort to manual paper-based transactions that create reconciliation nightmares. Expensive POS hardware with barcode scanners adds significant upfront costs for small businesses.

**Our Solution:** Lanzate works as a mobile-first POS system that runs on employees' phones, using the device camera to scan barcodes and QR codes. This eliminates the need for dedicated hardware and ensures business continuity even during power outages, as long as staff have charged mobile devices.

## Differentiators

### Custom Branded Subdomains
Unlike marketplace platforms where all stores look similar, we provide each merchant with their own subdomain (e.g., merchant.lanzate.com) and customizable styling. This creates a unique brand identity while maintaining the simplicity and affordability of a SaaS solution.

### Unified Multi-Channel Commerce
Unlike single-channel platforms, Lanzate seamlessly integrates online ordering with walk-in sales and multi-branch management. This results in accurate inventory across all locations, streamlined order processing, and comprehensive analytics that reflect the entire business.

### Mobile-First POS with Camera Scanning
Unlike traditional POS systems that require expensive hardware, Lanzate turns any smartphone into a fully functional cash register. Camera-based barcode and QR code scanning eliminates the need for dedicated scanners, while offline-capable mobile access ensures sales continue even during power outages.

### Built for Growth
While simple enough for a single-store owner, Lanzate scales to support multiple branches, employee management with role-based permissions, and advanced analytics. Businesses don't need to migrate platforms as they grow.

### Localized Payment Integration
Native integration with MercadoPago provides seamless payment processing optimized for Latin American markets, with support for local payment methods and currencies that global platforms often overlook.
