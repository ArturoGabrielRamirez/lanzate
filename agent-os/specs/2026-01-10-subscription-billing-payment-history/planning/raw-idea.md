# Raw Idea: Subscription Billing & Payment History

## Feature Description

Implement MercadoPago webhook integration to automatically track subscription payment transactions. Build payment history dashboard where users can view all subscription charges with status (successful, failed, pending, refunded), download invoices/receipts in PDF format, and track account plan changes (upgrades/downgrades between FREE, PRO, ENTERPRISE). Include webhook endpoint to receive MercadoPago IPN notifications and synchronize payment status. Generate simple invoices with basic billing information, designed with extensible data structure to support future integration with fiscal electronic invoicing systems (AFIP for Argentina, potentially other Latin American countries).
