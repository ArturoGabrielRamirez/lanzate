# Raw Idea: Store Creation & Management

**Feature Name:** Store Creation & Management

**Description:** Enable merchants to create their first store with basic information (name, description, subdomain). Implement subdomain routing and store ownership assignment. (Size: L)

**Additional Requirements:**
- Refactor the dashboard page so the navigation moves to the private layout instead, making it visible on any private page the user is in
- Update "account" links to "profile" since that's the actual available page's folder name

**Date Initiated:** 2026-01-06
